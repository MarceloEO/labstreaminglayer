Go to the [SCCN mirror](ftp://sccn.ucsd.edu/pub/software/LSL/) to get the most recent official releases of LSL packages, including separate Apps and SDK downloads. To save our bandwidth please consider downloading only the packages that you need instead of the all-inclusive package.

**Note:** The latest _stable_ release is 1.05.x (recommended for experimenters), and the current _developer_ release is 1.10.x (recommended for developers). The hardware support is identical, but 1.10.x is faster (better for low-powered devices) and has a better Software Development Kit.

Access to the latest source code and binaries is available at the [Source](https://code.google.com/p/labstreaminglayer/source/checkout) tab.
